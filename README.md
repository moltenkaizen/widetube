Youtube viewer that's always full-width
When viewing youtube tutorials on my laptop @ 1440x900 resolution, youtube wasn't full window width so I whipped together something quick. I was having a good time so I kept improving and building. Built a bookmarklet. It was a good oportunity to learn how to put together a gulp build system to handle ES6, SCSS, stylelint, and live reload with BrowserSync.
